In this assignment, you will implement a simple banking system using the basic concepts of Object Oriented Programming.

Accounts: In our banking system, there will be three types of accounts: Savings, Student, and Fixed deposit. For the sake of simplicity, assume an user can open one account only. You have to implement the following functionalities:

<ol>
<li>Create Account: After entering the system, users can request to open a new account with their name, account type, and initial deposit. A fixed deposit account must ensure the first deposit is at least 100,000$. After successful opening of the account, the user will be notified accordingly. If an account already exists against that name, an error message will be shown. Assume the names to be primary keys.</li>
<li>Deposit: An user can deposit any sum of money into an account, except for a fixed deposit account. The deposit amount must not be less than 50,000$ for the latter case.</li>
<li>Withdraw: Withdrawing is different across different account types:
<ol>
<li>(a) &nbsp;A student account cannot withdraw more than 10,000$ in one transaction.</li>
<li>(b) &nbsp;A fixed deposit account cannot withdraw if it has not reached a maturity period of one year.</li>
<li>(c) &nbsp;A savings account cannot withdraw if the withdrawal results in a deposit of less than 1,000$.</li>
</ol>
A transaction will be deemed invalid if the amount to withdraw exceeds the deposited sum.
</li>
<li>Request Loan: Any user can request a loan. The maximum allowable loan for savings, student, and fixed deposit accounts are 10,000$, 1,000$, 100,000$, respectively. All loans have a fixed 10% interest rate, which will be deducted after one year. The loans must be approved by an employee of the bank.</li>
<li>Query Deposit: An user can query the amount of deposit at any time.</li>
</ol>
Interest rates on deposit for savings, student, and fixed deposit accounts are 10%, 5%, 15%, re- spectively. All accounts except the student accounts will be deducted an amount of 500$ of service charge after one year.

Employees: There will be three types of employees in a banking system: Managing Director, Officer, and Cashier. There are different operations of employees based on their roles:

1. Lookup: Any employee can see the deposit sum of any user account.

2. Approve Loan: The Managing director and officer can approve loan requests of users.

3. Change Interest Rate: The managing director has the discretion to change the interest rates of different types of accounts.

4. See Internal Fund: The managing director can see the internal funds.

Maintain a bank class for handling the accounts and employees, and the internal fund. The initial fund is 1,000,000$. Assume the bank class will not be instantiated more than once, and the following employees will be created at the time of bank instantiation: 1 Managing Director (MD), 2 Officers (O1, O2), 5 Cashiers (C1, Â· Â· Â· , C5). Also maintain a clock variable to increment the year count of operation (assume all accounts are created at the same time).

Some test inputs and corresponding outputs are shown in Table 1.
